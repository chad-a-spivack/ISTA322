### 1. What is the purpose of the null conditional operator? Does it apply to value types or reference types?
Why or why not?

Allows you to deal with null values more elegantly.  It is a value type.  It is stored as declared value but it is simply just nullable.

### 2. What is the null coalescing operator? What does it do?

??, defines the null value instead of it simply just saying null.

### 3. How is the null conditional operator different from a nullable type? What is the purpose of nullable
types?

The nullable type allows you to define a value type as nullable rather than just a variable.

### 4. When you create an automatic property and initialize the property with a value, can the value be
changed later? Can another value be assigned to the property? Can the value be changed in the
constructor?

Yes you can.  Yes, you just assign it another value in a constructor.

### 5. What is an object initializer and what is it for? What is an collection initializer and what is it for?

Creates an opject and specifies its property values.  Creates a collection and its contents in single step.

### 6. What does the is keyword do?

Matches the specified type

### 7. How are extension methods defined?

defined within same namespace as a static class.

### 8. What is implicit typing or type inference? How do you implement it?

defining the class when calling a method. ex. Int.parse()

### 9. What is a default implementation of an interface? What is the purpose of a default implementation
of an interface?

Allows to you alter the implementation of the inetrface without altering the exisiting implementations

### 10. What are asynchronous methods? Why should we use them? How are they used?

Perform work in the background.  They eliminate coding bottle necks. await and async are the keywords.

### 11. When you use the await keyword, do you have to use the async keyword? Why or why not?

Yes. because of the way the compiler reads them.

### 12. (not in book) What is the yield keyword used for? How do you use it?

returns one element at a time

### 13. What is the effect of using the nameof() expression?

the compiler produces a name string instead of the user.
