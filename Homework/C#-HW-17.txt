### 1. What is a type parameter?

Specify types of objects on which they operate.

### 2. What does a type parameter do?

It allows the compiler to perfomr strict type checking at compile time and you no longer have to explicitly cast objects. Creates a new class.

### 3. How many type parameters can a generic class have?

multiple

### 4. What is the difference between a generic class and a generalized class?

Generalized class designed to take parameters that can be cast to different types.

### 5. What is a constraint? How do you specify a constraint?

You can limit the type parameters to those that implement a particular set of interfaces. Where T : Interface

### 6. What is a generic method? How do you define a generic method?

You can specify the types of parameters  and the reutrn type by using a type parameter.  The same way you define a generic class.

### 7. What do we mean when we cay that a generic type interface is invariant?

You can't assign an object of the interface to the class that inherits from it.

### 8. What do we mean when we cay that a generic type interface is covariant?

As long as their is a valid conversion, you can assign a to b and vice versa.

### 9. Does covariance work with value types? Does it work with reference types?

Only works with reference types.  Value types cannot form inheritance hierarchies.

### 10. What do we mean when we cay that a generic type interface is contravariant?

If a interface can take an object, it can take a string for example.
