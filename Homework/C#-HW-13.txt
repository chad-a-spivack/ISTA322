### 1. What is an interface as the term is used on object-oriented programmoing?

describes the functionality that class should provide but not how this functionality is implemented

### 2. How do you define an interface?

same way as a class except you use "interface" instead of "class"

### 3. Can an interface have variables, fields, or properties?

no

### 4. How do you define a method in an interface?

you declare the method and then replace the body with a semi-colon

### 5. Can you instantiate an object through an interface? Why or why not?

no because there is not an implementation of an interface. However you can if a class inherits from the interface 

### 6. Using the new keyword, can you declare a reference to an interface?

no, the object has to be instantiated by its class first and then you can reference the interface.

### 7. Can an object inherit from multiple interfaces? Can a class implement multiple interfaces? If so, how
can it do so?


yes, yes. separating the interfaces by commas.


### 8. What does it mean to explicitely implement an interface?

to declare which interface is coming from if a class inherits from multiple interfaces.  This matters when something has the name.

### 9. What are the restrictions on interfaces?

cant define constructors, can't specify access modifiers, can't nest types, can't inherit from a structure or class.

### 10. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?

abstract classes only exist to provide framework for an inherited class. abstract classes can have implementations.

### 11. What is an abstract method?

A method that is created to be overridden

### 12. What is an sealed class?

Prevents a class from being used as a base class.

### 13. What is an sealed method?

has to be in an unsealed class.  Makes an inherited class unable to inhertit the sealed method.
