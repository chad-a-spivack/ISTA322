### 1. Give five examples (using valid C# code) of the five bitwise operators listed in the text.

~, <<, |, &, ^

### 2. Does C# implement the right-shift (>>) operator? If so, give an example of its operation using valie
C# code.

Yes. 2 >> 204

### 3. Explain in detail this code: bits & (1 << index);.

What is the value of the 2nd bit from the right of the index value of the byte variable.

### 4. Explain in detail this code: bits |= (1 << index);.

Bit position goes from index to 1.

### 5. Explain in detail this code: bits &= (1 << index);.

Sets bit position at position index to 1.

### 6. How does C# interpret this? bool peek = bits[n];

Call to the get accessor for bits and the index argument is set to n.

### 7. How does C# interpret this? bits[n] = true;

set accessor which sets the index argument to n.

### 8. How does C# interpret this? bits[n] ^= true;

Gets the index value of n and sets it.

### 9. Assume that users were assigned read, write, and execute permissions according to this scheme: read
= 1, write = 2, execute = 4. How would you interpret the following user permissions:
(a) permission = 0

 none
 
(b) permission = 1

read

(c) permission = 2

write

(d) permission = 3

read, write

(e) permission = 4

execute


(f) permission = 5

read, execute

(g) permission = 6

read and execute

(h) permission = 7

read, write and execute

### 10. Answer the previous question by converting the decimal permissions into binary permissions. What
does this tell you about using this shceme of permissions?

read = 1, write = 10, execute = 100

permission =1

read

permission 10

write

permission 11

read + write

permission100

execute

permission 101

read + execute
