### 1. What is the difference between a property and a field?

Property is a combination of a field and a method.  Purpose is just to provide access to a field.

### 2. What is the difference between a property and a method?

property is a method that returns information about an object whereas a method causes the object to exhibit a kind of a behavior.

### 3. What is your understanding of encapsulation?

All the fields properties methods of a class are kept within that class unless explicity accessing them.  
If you do not want something to be accessed outside of the class you can use the private access modifier.

### 4. Some languages are case insensitive, that is, an ‘a” and an “A” are considered to be the same letter.
C# is case sensitive. What implications does this have regarding the naming of variables, methods,
and other identifiers? Do you think that the difference in case in the initial character of two different
identifiers is sufficient to distinguish them¿

No, I think it would be too confusing.  After writing a ton of code, you will probably forget which one is which and not understand why something is not working properly.
Easy solution is to name variable, object, etc very specifically even if it means typing more.

### 5. Give an example that is not in the book of an instance where you might want to use a read-only
property. Give an example not in the book of an instance where you might want to use s write-only
property.

A write only property could be a social security number. A read-only could be a customer ID.

### 6. Can you think of a reason why you might ever want to make getters and setters private? Give an
example. Also, make a case why getters and setters should never be private.

The user wouldnt be able to access their own data.  Better to just restrict the class instead of the getter, setters.

### 7. What are restrictions on the use of properties?

You only assign a property after the objectg has been instantiated. Property can only have one set and one get. They can't take parameters.

### 8. What is an object initializer? What is the syntax for an object initializer?

Sets a given property to a inputted value.  Class obj = new constructror {property value};
